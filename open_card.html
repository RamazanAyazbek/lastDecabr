    <p>Deng Xiaoping</p>

    <p>Deng Xiaoping[a] (22 August 1904 – 19 February 1997) was a Chinese revolutionary 
      leader, military commander and statesman who served as the paramount leader of the People'
      s Republic of China (PRC) from December 1978 to November 1989. After CCP chairman Mao Zedong's 
      death in 1976, Deng gradually rose to supreme power and led China through a series of far-reaching 
      market-economy reforms earning him the reputation as the "Architect 
      of Modern China". He contributed to China becoming the world's second largest economy
       by GDP nominal in 2010.
  
      Born in the province of Sichuan in the Qing dynasty, Deng
       studied and worked in France in the 1920s, where he became a follower of 
       Marxism–Leninism and joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1924.
        In early 1926, Deng travelled to Moscow to study Communist doctrines and became 
        a political commissar for the Red Army upon returning to China. In late 1929, Deng
         led local Red Army uprisings in Guangxi. In 1931, he was demoted within the party due
          to his support of Mao, but was promoted again during the Zunyi Conference.</p>

          <p>Deng played an important role in the Long March (1934–1935), the 
            Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and the Chinese Civil War (1945–1949). 
            Following the founding of the PRC on 1 October 1949, Deng worked in Tibet as well 
            as in southwest China as the regional party chief to consolidate CCP control until 1952, 
            when he returned to Beijing to serve in the central government. In 1955, when the PLA adopted 
            a Russian-style rank system, Deng was considered for the rank of Marshal of the People's Republic
             of China, which he declined to accept. As the party's Secretary-General under Chairman Mao Zedong 
             and Vice Premier under Premier Zhou Enlai in the 1950s, Deng presided over the Anti-Rightist Campaign 
             launched by Mao and became instrumental in China's economic reconstruction following the disastrous
              Great Leap Forward (1958–1960). However, his right-leaning political stance and economic policies
               eventually caused him to fall out of favor with Mao, and he was purged twice during the Cultural 
               Revolution (1966–1976).
  
            Following Mao's death in September 1976, Deng outmaneuvered
             the late chairman's chosen successor Hua Guofeng and became the de facto top leader 
             in December 1978 at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. Having inherited 
             a country beset with institutional disorder and disenchantment with Communism resulting from 
             the chaotic political movements of the Mao era, Deng started the "Boluan Fanzheng" program which
              gradually brought the country back to order. From 1977 to early 1979, he resumed the National 
              College Entrance Examination that had been interrupted by the Cultural Revolution for ten years,
               initiated the Reform and Opening-up of China, designated special economic zones including Shenzhen, 
               and started a one-month Sino-Vietnamese War. On 1 January 1979, the PRC established diplomatic
                relations with the United States, and Deng became the first Chinese paramount leader to visit 
                the U.S. In August 1980, Deng embarked on a series of political reforms by setting constitutional
                 term limits for state officials and other systematic revisions, which were incorporated in China's 
                 third Constitution (1982). In the 1980s, Deng supported the one-child policy to cope with China's 
                 perceived overpopulation crisis, helped establish China's nine-year compulsory education, and
                  launched the 863 Program for science and technology. Deng also proposed the One Country,
                   Two Systems principle for the governance of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the future 
                   unification with Taiwan.</p>
